# TotalityCorp Frontend Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the TotalityCorp Frontend Challenge. Below are the details of my approach and the tech stack used.

What i am good at:
React
Mui
Sass
useReducer
useContext api
Redux Toolkit

## Approach

I approached this challenge by utilizing the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: I carefully read and understood the challenge requirements to ensure clarity on what was expected.

2. **Tech Stack Selection**: I chose the following tech stack for the project:
   - Frontend Framework: React
   - Styling: SASS for CSS preprocessing
   - State Management: React Context API

3. **Project Structure**: I organized the project structure in a way that promotes modularity and maintainability.

4. **Component Breakdown**: I divided the UI into reusable components, such as header, sidebar, and content sections, to ensure a clean and structured layout.

5. **Styling**: I used SASS to enhance the styling process, making it more organized and efficient.

6. **State Management**: I employed React Context API for state management, enabling the sharing of state across components.

7. **Testing and Debugging**: I thoroughly tested the components and functionality to identify and fix any issues.

## Tech Stack

- React
- SASS (SCSS)
- React Context API
